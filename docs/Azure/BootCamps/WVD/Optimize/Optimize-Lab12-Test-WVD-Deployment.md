    > **NOTE:** These credentials are to logon to a computer in the pool.
6. Once connected, change the desktop background to a different picture.
7. Disconnect from the session.

## Exercise 3 - Host Pool Validation Tag

By default, the WVD agent on each host will auto update as new versions release. You can prevent this behavior by setting the **ValidationEng** flag in a host pool to true (by default itâ€™s set to false). With the ValidationEng flag set to true ONLY the host in that host pool will auto update giving administrators control to test new WVD host images, and the newest agents before rolling to production.

To enable this setting follow the PowerShell steps below.

1. Return to your PowerShell window.

2. Enter the following:

```powershell
Add-RDSAccount -DeploymentUrl
[https://rdbroker.wvd.microsoft.com](https://rdbroker.wvd.microsoft.com/)
```

### Choose a Host Pool for the validation pool

1. Enter the following:

    ```powershell
    Set-RdsHostPool -Name <HostPoolName> -TenantName <yourTenantName>
    -ValidationEnv $True or $False
    ```

## Exercise 4 - Other Common Settings

### Tenant Friendly Name

You can give your WVD Tenant a friendly name that will look less technical.

1. Enter the following:

    ```powershell
    Set-RdsTenant -Name \<WVD Tenant\> -FriendlyName "Contoso WVD"
    ```

### Desktop Friendly Name

Using the `Set-RdsRemoteDesktop`PowerShell cmdlet the FriendlyName option allows you customize the name users see on the Web Client or Thick Client.

1. Enter the following:

    ```powershell
    Set-RdsRemoteDesktop -TenantName <tenant> -HostPoolName <Host Pool>
    -AppGroupName "Desktop Application Group" -FriendlyName "<enter a friendly name>"
    ```
